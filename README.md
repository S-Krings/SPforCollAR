TARPS is a Unity toolbox enancing collaborative AR applications with privacy and security. It enables Unity developers without prior education in privacy and security to add a protection features directly into an existing application. To do so, developers can use a UI to choose from a selection of pre-defined protection features which are then integrated into the application the library was added to. These features work mostly out-of-the box and TARPS provides instructions in case additional integration stes are necessary.
